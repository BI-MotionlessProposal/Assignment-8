# Part 1: Accuracy and recall

# Part 1.1 
# Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value. 
# Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other. 
# Precision is independent of accuracy. You can be very precise but inaccurate, as described above. You can also be accurate but imprecise. (reference: https://labwrite.ncsu.edu/Experimental%20Design/accuracyprecision.htm)

# Part 1.2
# Precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.
# Recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. (reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
